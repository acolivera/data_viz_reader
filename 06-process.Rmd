# How to run a data viz project



## How to structure a data visualization project
[@data_viz_idea]

### Bring big data visualization up front

Enterprises are finding ways to create data visualization front ends that can be explored by front-line workers.
Rather than have developers create a purpose-built app, enterprises can wire up Google's Data Studio to their data sources, then create and style a simple UI with Analytics Canvas.

###  Connect time and space

Marketers use location intelligence to understand consumer preferences, behavior or loyalty based on when, where and how often someone shows up. Customer support managers use location intelligence to create better customer experiences, since physical location is usually a big part of servicing a customer -- from predicting arrival, delivering timely solutions to urgent issues and routing. Business development teams use location intelligence to reduce risk for future investments, such as where to open a new store, where to drill a new well, or where to construct a new cell tower.

### Visualize the voice of the employee

Large organizations realize that employee turnover is a problem, but they struggle to shift to a more personalized and prescriptive engagement strategy. With a higher demand on skilled resources, increased attrition, and costly hiring and on-boarding processes, U.S. businesses are losing millions to tens of millions of dollars every year due to turnover.
Some employee experience elements that Acumen has built visualizations for include employee interaction analysis to visualize the drivers and satisfaction across multiple channels and workforce landscape analysis to understand workforce makeup and which types of employees are more or less loyal.

### Map data visualization to the real world

In general, visual analytics experts recommend focusing on simple charts and lines to make it easier to tease apart relationships between elements in big data. 
For example, a data visualization project on flight seat analysis for a major airline. Using seat booking data from millions of transactions, the team built a visualization shaped like an airplane with the exact seating arrangement as the actual aircraft. The seats that generated more revenue appeared darker in the visualization, helping the airline identify profitable seats that could bepriced  higher, along with the poorly occupied ones that needed promotions. These visualizations were interactive and could be analyzed across several parameters to get deeper insights.

## General Introduction

## Important Prerequisites of data visualization project

[@prerequisites_viz]

The below are the important prerequisites of a successful data visualization project.

+ ** As a data visual designer, understanding the goal of the project** is very important for a successful visualization project.Sometimes you may not be aware of the project goal, but you may know the reason why you are creating the visualization. This understanding will result in a good design.
+ ** Understanding the audience ** how they will process this visualization is another important prerequisite. Designing a visualization for scientists is entirely different from a visualization designed for law-makers or for general public. 
+ ** Understanding the data you are trying to visualize ** such as shape and dimension of the data, is data time-series, relationship in data between entities,categorical attribute exists is also an important prerequisite.


Defining the project:
[@prerequisites_vizhitachi]

+ ** Behind every project there is an organization need. The need could be simple or cumbersome, however you want to be able to have a measurable objective with the goal to deliver the right information. To do this you need to set requirements, design processes, schedule regular discussions with users and continue these meetings until the final project rollout. 
Sample questions that can help one understand the project better:
what is the organization need you are trying to address?
What are the main data sources you need to access?
Is there a measurable goal you want to achieve?


Data Visualization Selection:
[@prerequisites_vizhitachi]

+ ** Selecting the right visualization is key to your project. Most user want to see 'Key performance indicators' which are the main drivers for visualizations. The following are different kinds of visualizations that can be used to display KPIs:
Quantities: counts or measures. Example - Count of likes or comments
Trends and changes over time:  time series. Example - Change in sales quantity over time 
Relatives Share and proportions:  display relationship between the parts and the whole. Example - breakdown of a stock portfolio by asset.
Ranked list: although not a real data visualization, it could achieve the goal needed.
Geographical Location: Gives user spatial and physical relationships.

Choosing a tool to visualize:
[@prerequisites_tools]

The tool to be used for visualization.This depends on the person conducting the visualization, and the platform he wants to integrate his work into.It also depends on the ability of the user eg:-Tableau has a no code approach whereas D3.js ,Altair etc.These approaches are discussed in detail below: 

**No coding** :

On can start with MS Excel and probably use pivot tables feature, in excel you come up with decent charts.

If you already have some data and need a powerful tool to explore the data visually, Tableau is the tool. There is a free public version and a paid version , which students can get for free. One can publish the charts to web .To start Tableau Public website has a good number of examples to take inspiration from.

**Some coding:**

If somebody wants to venture in the coding world to build charts, R is a good start. It is easy to learn, free as it is opensource.One can us the ggplot library in R to come up with visual data exploration. You can publish these charts with the help Shiny package and add a bit of interaction as well.

  **More coding:**

This section is derived because of recent innovation in interactive visualization, especially on the web. One might ask where to start to come up with interactive visualizations as good as New York Times. The answer is D3.js, many of the data visualizations running in the browser today is D3.js, created by Mike Bostock. This does mean you&#39;ll need to learn some Javascript in general and then D3.js specifically. One area to call out as a particular strength of D3 is geospatial visualizations. D3 is great at creating maps of many flavors.

Finally, if you really want to learn a do-it-all programming language that just happens to be great at data visualization, go with Python. Python is a general purpose and powerful tool, and it&#39;s quite popular in the data science community. Finally, much like D3.js for Javascript or ggplot for R, there are many Python libraries dedicated to data visualization. Seaborn (which builds on an older popular library, matplotlib) and Bokeh are probably the best-in-class right now, but this is a quickly evolving and improving landscape. Both the [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/examples/index.html) and [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html) websites include galleries showing off the kinds of visualizations you can create with those tools.

### Useful platforms and tips for data visualization project
Many free and web-based tools are very good for non-developers to design high quality visualization, especially these tools are no coding necessary.  Here is the tool list for reference:

1. Excel is one of the most widely used spreadsheet programs in the world, and comes built-in with many options for creating charts and graphs with an eye toward common business applications, from representing profit-and-loss to showing stock performance.
2. Google Sheets contains a number of visualization options similar to Excel. With just a few clicks, anyone can put together a number of basic graphs, from line charts to bar graphs to scatterplots and histograms. Helpfully, Google Sheets looks at your data and grays out any options that aren’t appropriate for your spreadsheet, making it easy to quickly compare different plots.
3. Raw is an open, customizable tool for building vector-based graphs and charts, built on D3.js. It allows you to simply copy and paste your data from Excel or Google Sheets, select a chart type, and customize it based on the variables and relationships you want to highlight. Once it’s ready to go, you can export it as an svg, image, or JSON data model.
 
4. Google Data Studio is a relatively new product from Google that’s designed to make it easy for marketing teams to create detailed, shareable, interactive reports. It uses a simple drag-and-drop interface and templates to make putting together reports easy and quick. As you might expect, it integrates easily with data from other Google Analytics sources.

5. TimelineJS provides an easy-to-use template for creating and embedding interactive timelines on the web. It’s especially great for blogs and other publications, and has been used by Time, CNN, Le Monde, and more.

6. Plotly is a web app for creating charts and dashboards that’s popular with both data scientists as well as journalists from major organizations like the Washington Post, Boston Globe, and Wired. It’s basically a GUI for D3.js, which makes it well suited to building highly responsive graphs.  For heavier duty projects, it also comes with APIs for Python, R, Matlab, and other data science tools.
 
### FOR COMPLEX PROJECTS
Because some companies such as data-heavy startups, governmental organizations, and major corporations are making strategic decisions and analysis on complex data set, and shows complex 2d and 3d representations. The article ‘19 tools for data visualization project  visualization tools can manage heavy duty data and projects. 

1. **Tableau** is an extremely popular data visualization and exploration tool used by a number of startups. It comes in a few different versions, from a full-featured Business Intelligence platform to a free cloud-based version for smaller companies and projects. It’s popular for its rich visualizations and an intuitive interface that makes it easy to use even for non-specialist. It also has a slick mobile app and can be embedded in other applications that want to make attractive analytics available to their users.

2. **D3.js** is a JavaScript library that uses HTML, CSS, and SVG to create a wide variety of dynamic, interactive visualizations. It emphasizes web standards, allowing it to take full advantage of modern browser technologies without being tied down to any one framework. It’s been used by the New York Times for some of their rich graphical features.

3.  **ggplot2** is a visualization package for R. At its core, ggplot2 abstracts graphs into certain basic building blocks like data, scales, layers, and transformations. This makes it easier for developers to tailor their graphs to their taste without sweating the details, though this flexibility comes at a cost to speed.

4. **NetworkX** is a Python library that allows you to create and analyze graphs and networks. It’s designed to work with both standard and nonstandard data formats, which makes it especially efficient and scalable. All this makes NetworkX especially well suited to analyzing complex social networks.

5.**matplotlib** is the standard Python library for creating 2D plots and graphs. It’s pretty low-level, meaning it requires more commands to generate nice-looking graphs and figures than with some more advanced libraries. However, the flip side of that is flexibility. With enough commands, you can make just about any kind of graph you want with matplotlib.

6. **Seaborn** is a popular visualization library for Python that builds on matplotlib’s foundation. The first thing you’ll notice about Seaborn is that its default styles are much more sophisticated than matplotlib’s. Beyond that, Seaborn is a higher-level library, meaning it’s easier to generate certain kinds of plots, including heat maps, time series, and violin plots.
