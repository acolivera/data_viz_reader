As with all other projects, the planning phase of a data visualization project is essential to ensure the final product of the project is an effective visualization - one that is easily understood, provides insight and perhaps stimulate an action from the reader. A well planned project also helps to reduce the number of iterations, or going back-and-forth, during the development of the visualizations and trying to make it fit with the narrative of the story being told through the visualizations. At the core of all data visualization is its dataset. Each set of data has its own particular display needs, and the purpose for which you’re using the data set has just as much of an effect on those needs as the data itself. Understanding the characteristics of your data set can help you to determine what kind of visualization you’ll use. (Fry 2007) Some important points to keep in mind when planing a project are: Too Much Information We should always remember that while we want to present information to our audience, the reader, we also do not want to present too much information that the visualization becomes challenging to understand and confuses the reader more than helps to clarify a situation. Data Collection Ensure that the data is obtained from a reliable source and that breadth and depth of the data is sufficient to establish a belief in the story being presented. What Is the Question? Finding the Story (Fry 2007) When beginning a visualization project, while it is common to focus on the data that has been collected, we need to remember that great information visualization never starts from the standpoint of the data set, but rather, it starts with questions. Why was the data collected, what’s interesting about it, and what stories can it tell? Think about how the data will be used and work backward to what was collected. You collect data because you want to know something about it. If you don’t really know why you’re collecting it, you’re just hoarding it! Be concise and specific with your questions and this will lead to clear results. When questions have a broad scope, as in “exploratory data analysis” phase, the answers themselves will be broad and often geared toward those who are themselves versed in the data. One of the most important (and least technical) skills in understanding data is asking good questions. An appropriate question shares an interest you have in the data, tries to convey it to others, and is curiosity-oriented rather than math-oriented. Visualizing data is just like any other type of communication: success is defined by your audience’s ability to pick up on, and be excited about, your insight. Admittedly, you may have a rich set of data to which you want to provide flexible access by not defining your question too narrowly. Even then, your goal should be to highlight key findings. There is a tendency in the visualization field to borrow from the statistics field and separate problems into exploratory and expository, but for the purposes of this book, this distinction is not useful. The same methods and process are used for both. In short, a proper visualization is a kind of narrative, providing a clear answer to a question without extraneous details. By focusing on the original intent of the question, you can eliminate such details because the question provides a benchmark for what is and is not necessary. Ben Fry in his book on Visualizing Data, shares the 7 stages in visualizing data as follows: Acquire - Obtain the data, whether from a file on a disk or a source over a network. Parse - Provide some structure for the data’s meaning, and order it into categories. Filter - Remove all but the data of interest. Mine - Apply methods from statistics or data mining as a way to discern patterns or place the data in mathematical context. Represent - Choose a basic visual model, such as a bar graph, list, or tree. Refine - Improve the basic representation to make it clearer and more visually engaging. Interact - Add methods for manipulating the data or controlling what features are visible. 6.2 How to structure a data visualization project (Lawton 2018) 6.2.1 Bring big data visualization up front Enterprises are finding ways to create data visualization front ends that can be explored by front-line workers. Rather than have developers create a purpose-built app, enterprises can wire up Google’s Data Studio to their data sources, then create and style a simple UI with Analytics Canvas. 6.2.2 Connect time and space Marketers use location intelligence to understand consumer preferences, behavior or loyalty based on when, where and how often someone shows up. Customer support managers use location intelligence to create better customer experiences, since physical location is usually a big part of servicing a customer – from predicting arrival, delivering timely solutions to urgent issues and routing. Business development teams use location intelligence to reduce risk for future investments, such as where to open a new store, where to drill a new well, or where to construct a new cell tower. 6.2.3 Visualize the voice of the employee Large organizations realize that employee turnover is a problem, but they struggle to shift to a more personalized and prescriptive engagement strategy. With a higher demand on skilled resources, increased attrition, and costly hiring and on-boarding processes, U.S. businesses are losing millions to tens of millions of dollars every year due to turnover. Some employee experience elements that Acumen has built visualizations for include employee interaction analysis to visualize the drivers and satisfaction across multiple channels and workforce landscape analysis to understand workforce makeup and which types of employees are more or less loyal. 6.2.4 Map data visualization to the real world In general, visual analytics experts recommend focusing on simple charts and lines to make it easier to tease apart relationships between elements in big data. For example, a data visualization project on flight seat analysis for a major airline. Using seat booking data from millions of transactions, the team built a visualization shaped like an airplane with the exact seating arrangement as the actual aircraft. The seats that generated more revenue appeared darker in the visualization, helping the airline identify profitable seats that could bepriced higher, along with the poorly occupied ones that needed promotions. These visualizations were interactive and could be analyzed across several parameters to get deeper insights. ======= ## General Introduction 6.3 Important Prerequisites of data visualization project (Vantara 2019) The below are the important prerequisites of a successful data visualization project. ** As a data visual designer, understanding the goal of the project** is very important for a successful visualization project.Sometimes you may not be aware of the project goal, but you may know the reason why you are creating the visualization. This understanding will result in a good design. ** Understanding the audience ** how they will process this visualization is another important prerequisite. Designing a visualization for scientists is entirely different from a visualization designed for law-makers or for general public. ** Understanding the data you are trying to visualize ** such as shape and dimension of the data, is data time-series, relationship in data between entities,categorical attribute exists is also an important prerequisite. Defining the project: (sas.com 2019) ** Behind every project there is an organization need. The need could be simple or cumbersome, however you want to be able to have a measurable objective with the goal to deliver the right information. To do this you need to set requirements, design processes, schedule regular discussions with users and continue these meetings until the final project rollout. Sample questions that can help one understand the project better: what is the organization need you are trying to address? What are the main data sources you need to access? Is there a measurable goal you want to achieve? Data Visualization Selection: (sas.com 2019) ** Selecting the right visualization is key to your project. Most user want to see ‘Key performance indicators’ which are the main drivers for visualizations. The following are different kinds of visualizations that can be used to display KPIs: Quantities: counts or measures. Example - Count of likes or comments Trends and changes over time: time series. Example - Change in sales quantity over time Relatives Share and proportions: display relationship between the parts and the whole. Example - breakdown of a stock portfolio by asset. Ranked list: although not a real data visualization, it could achieve the goal needed. Geographical Location: Gives user spatial and physical relationships. Choosing a tool to visualize: (medium.com 2015) The tool to be used for visualization.This depends on the person conducting the visualization, and the platform he wants to integrate his work into.It also depends on the ability of the user eg:-Tableau has a no code approach whereas D3.js ,Altair etc.These approaches are discussed in detail below: No coding : On can start with MS Excel and probably use pivot tables feature, in excel you come up with decent charts. If you already have some data and need a powerful tool to explore the data visually, Tableau is the tool. There is a free public version and a paid version , which students can get for free. One can publish the charts to web .To start Tableau Public website has a good number of examples to take inspiration from. Some coding: If somebody wants to venture in the coding world to build charts, R is a good start. It is easy to learn, free as it is opensource.One can us the ggplot library in R to come up with visual data exploration. You can publish these charts with the help Shiny package and add a bit of interaction as well. More coding: This section is derived because of recent innovation in interactive visualization, especially on the web. One might ask where to start to come up with interactive visualizations as good as New York Times. The answer is D3.js, many of the data visualizations running in the browser today is D3.js, created by Mike Bostock. This does mean you'll need to learn some Javascript in general and then D3.js specifically. One area to call out as a particular strength of D3 is geospatial visualizations. D3 is great at creating maps of many flavors. Finally, if you really want to learn a do-it-all programming language that just happens to be great at data visualization, go with Python. Python is a general purpose and powerful tool, and it's quite popular in the data science community. Finally, much like D3.js for Javascript or ggplot for R, there are many Python libraries dedicated to data visualization. Seaborn (which builds on an older popular library, matplotlib) and Bokeh are probably the best-in-class right now, but this is a quickly evolving and improving landscape. Both the Seaborn and Bokeh websites include galleries showing off the kinds of visualizations you can create with those tools. References "]
