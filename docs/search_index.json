In the previous chapters, we have presented some important theoretical and practical principles to keep in mind when designing a data visualization. We have also discussed and critiqued several examples of data visualizations, learning common pitfalls and helpful tricks along the way. As we have seen, developing an effective and ethical data visualization is a complex process. The journey from raw data to successful data visualization involves representing the data of interest, processing the data to extract relevant information for the desired argument, designing a mapping of this information to a visual representation, rendering this representation, and combining all this functionality in an easy-to-use product. 7.1 The Future of Data Visualization Towler (2015) Data visualization is entering a new era. Emerging sources of intelligence, theoretical developments and advances in multidimensional imaging are reshaping the potential value that analytics and insights can provide, with visualization playing a key role. The principles of effective data visualization won’t change. However, nextgen technologies and evolving cognitive frameworks are opening new horizons, moving data visualization from art to science. Looking back, much attention has been given to the principles of effective data visualization, such as substance, context and actionability. As timeless tenets that will continue to be important, regardless of medium or format, a brief review seems in order: As with any form of communication, effectively conveying a message with data requires that it be substantive. And while creative visuals can enhance interest and memory, embellishment can’t make up for lack of substance. According to purist Edward Tufte, “Every single pixel should testify directly to content.” Visualization should be accurate and contextual. David McCandless’s Billion Dollar O’Gram provides an example of how greater meaning can be added by incorporating the bigger picture. According to McCandless, “Absolute figures in a connected world don’t give you the whole picture. They’re not as true as they could be. We need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture.” Billion Dollar O’Gram (Source: Towler (2015)) More than anything else, data visualization should facilitate decision-making, a goal that is difficult to achieve for many. According to a recent KPMG study, while data and analytics are deemed increasingly important to organizations, generating actionable insights remains a top challenge. Looking forward, nextgen technologies and evolving cognitive frameworks will boost the role that data visualization can play in organizations and society. Consider the Internet of Things, Network and Complexity Theories, and recent developments in multidimensional visualization: The Internet has transformed the way we visualize information through a better understanding of networks and an explosion in profile, behavioral and attitudinal data. Sociograms, for example, have gone from relatively simple graphs to multifaceted relational maps, as illustrated in the following two charts, courtesy of the Journal of Social Structure and the Leadership Learning Community. Figure 2:Pre-Internet sociogram (Source: Towler (2015)) Figure 3:Internet-age sociogram (Source: Towler (2015)) The Internet of Things is expected to have a similar impact, with billions of connected devices capturing human and machine activity. Fully capitalizing on the data generated will require further advances in our ability to synthesize and display spatiotemporal activities. Network Theory has been in use for decades, with its earliest applications largely in social structure analysis. More recently, Network Theory is being applied to understand relationships and interactions in a variety of domains, such as crime prevention and disease management. Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbling’s work modeling the spread of infectious diseases provides an example of the power that Network Theory holds. 7.2 Key Lessons Going Forward Don’t try to be too cute. Using all the fancy features of a visualization tool can lead to complex and confusing graphics. Just because you have a flashy hammer, it does not mean that everything is a nail. Don’t lose your purpose in your infatuation with a new tool or feature. Stick to good design principles, and keep it simple (as was mentioned in the discussion about Patterns). Don’t provide more data than you need to tell your story. Humans have a tendency to want to create visualizations with multi-drill downs, filters, and tables. This is fine for ad hoc analysis, but if we are presenting a visual with a single story or argument, we must make sure every piece of data included plays a meaningful part in the story. Have more data to show what-ifs. A great way to provide more information in a visualization is to use filters to provide what-if views. Having filters for different scenarios, options, and time slices provide the user a way to review and discover various perspectives on your data. Just make sure the user does not have to work too hard to get there and that they do not get lost in the data. Deliver value in your visualization. Many graphs may be aesthetically pleasing or exciting but deliver no value. A graph with good value should deliver important insights to aid decision-making or prompt an action. Keep in mind, the main objective of a visualization is to deliver value, and each design decision should help achieve this. Understanding your audience is the most difficult and important part of developing a visualization. Different audiences will feel differently about the same chart. So when we develop the argument from the data, we should keep our intended audience in mind. Share what you have found. A visualization can be an effective influencer if used in the correct way and at the correct time. Think as author / reader When designing the graph, try to stand at the reader side, to check whether the graph is make sense or is there any misleading happening? as a reader, sometimes need stand at the author side, you need to detect is there any visualization deception in the graph, before making any conclusion, understand very details and information the graph provided, legend, caption, numbers, etc. Do Calculations Represent the data accurately is necessary, but sometime the original data cannot strongly support your main thesis. Some extra calcuation based on the original dataset could make your idea more clearly. It should be ethical Visualization: Research has found that even if viewers do not support an idea, data presented in charts can persuade viewers on the subject matter. It means that visualization can also be used to mislead either unintentionally or intentionally. Misleading, incomprehensible, or incredible data visualization can jeopardize people’s trust, goodwill, or faith in research and advocacy on vital human rights issues. So, certain standards should be followed in order to generate meaningful, accurate and ethical visuals Laying the groundwork for data visualization (SAS NA) Before implementing new technology, there are some steps you need to take. Not only do you need to have a solid grasp on your data, you also need to understand your goals, needs and audience. Preparing your organization for data visualization technology requires that you first: Understand the data you’re trying to visualize, including its size and cardinality (the uniqueness of data values in a column). Determine what you’re trying to visualize and what kind of information you want to communicate. Know your audience and understand how it processes visual information. Use a visual that conveys the information in the best and simplest form for your audience. Once you’ve answered those initial questions about the type of data you have and the audience who’ll be consuming the information, you need to prepare for the amount of data you’ll be working with. Big data brings new challenges to visualization because large volumes, different varieties and varying velocities must be taken into account. Plus, data is often generated faster that it can be managed and analyzed. How Is It Being Used? (SAS NA) Regardless of industry or size, all types of businesses are using data visualization to help make sense of their data. Here’s how. Comprehend information quickly By using graphical representations of business information, businesses are able to see large amounts of data in clear, cohesive ways – and draw conclusions from that information. And since it’s significantly faster to analyze information in graphical format (as opposed to analyzing information in spreadsheets), businesses can address problems or answer questions in a more timely manner. Identify relationships and patterns Even extensive amounts of complicated data start to make sense when presented graphically; businesses can recognize parameters that are highly correlated. Some of the correlations will be obvious, but others won’t. Identifying those relationships helps organizations focus on areas most likely to influence their most important goals. Pinpoint emerging trends Using data visualization to discover trends – both in the business and in the market – can give businesses an edge over the competition, and ultimately affect the bottom line. It’s easy to spot outliers that affect product quality or customer churn, and address issues before they become bigger problems. Communicate the story to others Once a business has uncovered new insights from visual analytics, the next step is to communicate those insights to others. Using charts, graphs or other visually impactful representations of data is important in this step because it’s engaging and gets the message across quickly. 7.3 Additional Resources for Aspiring Data Visualizers The field of data visualization is huge, and the capability of linking storytelling and data-experience design is a commodity.
