**1.evaluation framework**
Data visualization helps people to understand data more easily and effective. A good data visualization may consists of seven criteria, which fall into two general categories: criteria that address the degree to which a visualization is informative (i.e., produces understanding) and criteria that address the degree to which it is emotive (i.e., produces a useful emotional response):


**1.1 Informative**

**1.1.1 Usefulness**
First and the most important criteria is if the data visualization is useful or not. If people can learn better from raw data directly than graph, it's not necessary to do a data visualization. People need a vivid graph to help them understand the data.

**1.1.2Completeness**
An effective data visualization includes all of the information that???s needed to produce the intended level of understanding, but not more. This involves the right information and the right amount of it. This also means that all of the context that???s needed to understand the information has been provided as well. Context is usually provided in the form of comparisons, such as comparisons to targets, measures of the norm, and historical values.

**1.1.3 Perceptibility**
The information must be displayed in a manner that the human eye and brain can perceive with minimal effort and appropriate precision. This involves selecting the type of graph that displays the information most effectively and designing it in a way that presents the information as clearly as possible. Forcing people to compare the sizes or color intensities of objects, which is somewhat difficult and imprecise, when the positions or lengths of objects could have been used instead, reduces perceptibility.

**1.1.4 Truthfulness**
It means the degree to which a data visualization is accurate and valid. Accuracy is a measure of reliability and appropriate precision. Validity indicates how well something represents what it claims. Data visualizations should exhibit both attributes to the fullest. If a bar in a bar graph that is twice the height of another represents anything other than twice the value, it is inaccurate. If a graph presents a country???s median household income as a measure of its people???s happiness, it is invalid.

**1.1.5 Intuitiveness**
A data visualization is intuitive to the degree that it is familiar and easily understood. Whether or not a particular form of display is intuitive depends entirely on the audience. A parallel coordinates plot would be unfamiliar to most members of the general public, but familiar to select groups of scientists and statisticians.


**1.2 Emotive**

**1.2.1 Aesthetics**
The aesthetic quality of a data visualization can range from ugly (a display that no one would choose to view for long) to beautiful (one that would invite even those who care little for the information to take perhaps delight in learning about it). In between ugly and beautiful lie data visualizations that are merely pleasing to the eye, which is usually adequate, except on those occasions when the audience must be given an extra incentive beyond their own natural interests to examine what they might otherwise ignore.

**2.1.Human VS Natual influences on climate**

![Human VS Natual influences on climate](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-07/models-observed-human-natural.png)

*2.1.1*
Usefulness: ****(total 5 star)
It helps people to understand how Natural Factor and Human Factor influences on climate seperately overtime(1900-2000)

*2.1.2*
Completeness: *****
For the title's perspective, it provided in the form of comparisons(HUman VS Natural), as well as comparisons to targets(Observations), measures of the norm and historical values(Global Temperature Change).

*2.1.3*
Perceptibility:**
It is readable, but it is a bit confusing, because 'Natural and Human Factors' and 'Natural Factors Only' kind of overlapped of Natural part, it would be better devide 'Natual' and 'Human' factor purely.

*2.1.4*
Truthfulness:***
The graph seems accurate and valid, except for the part that mentioned above. If it can use 'Human factor only' and 'Natural factor only' would be more accurate.

*2.1.5*
Intuitiveness:****
The line and different color made the chart easily to understand.

*2.1.6*
Aesthetics:***
It is a normal chart with clearly line and color.



**2.2.Contributors to Global Warming over the Past 50-65 Years**

![Contributors to Global Warming over the Past 50-65 Years](https://static.skepticalscience.com/graphics/GW_Attribution_med.jpg)

*2.2.1*
Usefulness: **
It helps people to understand Natural and Human contribution on global warming fro the past 50-65 years based on 10 different studies(different color in the graph), but not so important for audience to know the slightly different between each studies. Because they all show Human contribute more than natural on global warming.

*2.2.2*
Completeness: **
It provided the differences(contribution) based on different study, as well as two targets(Human VS Natural).

###2.2.3
Perceptibility:***
It is readable, but it is a bit confusing about the describtion, better to add a title on the 10 study.

*2.2.4*
Truthfulness:***
The graph seems accurate and valid.

###2.2.5
Intuitiveness:***
The histogram is easily understand with different color devided into two catagory. 

*2.2.6*
Aesthetics:***
It is a normal histogram with clearly line and color.




**2.3.Natural Greenhouse Effect VS Human Enhanced Greenhouse Effect**

![Natural Greenhouse Effect VS Human Enhanced Greenhouse Effect](https://i2.wp.com/timescavengers.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gh_effect-01.jpg)

*2.3.1*
Usefulness: ****
It shows that human activities enhanced Greenhouse effect compare to Natural Greenhouse effect, which cause global warming.So the graph is useful.

*2.3.2*
Completeness: **
It use picture to compare the amount of re-radiated heat reflected to earth with and without human activities.But data was not provided.

*2.3.3*
Perceptibility:****
It is pretty easy to read at the first sight.

*2.3.4*
Truthfulness:***
The graph is valid, but if it comes with data would be more accurate.

*2.3.5*
Intuitiveness:****
The histogram is easily understandable with a vivid earth shape and the mimic the radiation. 

*2.3.6*
Aesthetics:***
It is simple, the visualization of the sun and radiation can be more pretty .


**2.4.Amount of human-caused warming**

![Amount of human-caused warming](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2017/07/Humantcontribution.jpg)


*2.4.1*
Usefulness: ****
It shows the likelyhood that human activities cause global warming, with percetage and decribe. It is helpful to audience understand the amount of human-caused global warming is significantly increase in the past 30 years

*2.4.2*
Completeness: ****
It includes picture, data(percetage), and decription, simple but complete.

*2.4.3*
Perceptibility:****
It use human figure and blue/white color to show the significant change from 1995 to 2001, the amount of human-caused warming was increase dramatically during this period.

*2.4.4*
Truthfulness:***
The graph is accurate and valid.

*2.4.5*
Intuitiveness:****
It is easily to read and understand for audience. 

*2.4.6*
Aesthetics:***
It is simple but interesting.

**2.4.Opposite example**

![How much does human activity affect greenhouse gases](https://www.dailysignal.com//wp-content/uploads/2009/03/human-global-warming.jpg)

*2.4.1*
Usefulness: *****
Different from the 4 graph above, this picture shows an opposite point of view. Despite the correctness, it help audience gather all kinds of information and come to a reasonable conclusion.

*2.4.2*
Completeness: ****
It includes picture, data(percetage), and decription, simple but complete.

*2.4.3*
Perceptibility:****
The graph is very simple but good for portion display, audience can easily have sense at the first sight.

*2.4.4*
Truthfulness:****
The graph is accurate and valid.

*2.4.5*
Intuitiveness:****
It is easily to read and understand. 

*2.4.6*
Aesthetics:**
It is simple regular visualization.

**Inconclusion, those 5 graph use different visualization method and display to show human activities' influence on global warming, all of them are using comparison. Either compare with Natural effect, or compare with different time line, or using proportion. This shows a good visualization needs to deliver a accurate and measurable information to the audience, the best way is comparison.**
